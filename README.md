# Flappy Dragon

A `flappy bird` clone ðŸ¤­

Going through Herbert Wolverson's excellent [Hands-on Rust](https://pragprog.com/titles/hwrust/hands-on-rust/), and `flappy` (bird) is one the projects you get to make with the author:-)

## Usage

> Clone the repo and CD into the newly created directory on your computer:

```bash
$ git@github.com:clovisphere/flappy-dragon.git
$ cd flappy-dragon
```

If you have [Rust installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), you'll only need to run:

```bash
$ cargo run
```

Et voila!
